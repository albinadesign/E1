    <h1>My main profession is Interior design</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4><p>I'm an experienced interior designer. In fact, programming is like a hobby for me. 
       Recently I moved to Philippines with my family and decided to try a new profession.
       However, I'm still working online on my interior projects and love this!</p>
    <p>And I love programming too. I'm thinking of creating a useful app for interior designers.
       And that was the reason I started this at all. Also, I find pleasure in creating something beautiful 
       and useful. And creating web sites is just a perfect choice. I have created several sites for my practice
       using Wix platform </p></h4>
